Use a Cloudflare Tunnel to remotely connect to Home Assistant without opening any ports.

## About

Cloudflared creates a secure tunnel between your Home Assistant instance and Cloudflare's network, allowing you to access your instance remotely without exposing it directly to the internet. This is more secure than traditional port forwarding or dynamic DNS solutions.

**Benefits:**
- üîí No ports to open on your router
- üåê Free secure remote access
- üöÄ Fast global CDN performance
- üõ°Ô∏è DDoS protection from Cloudflare
- üîê Optional Cloudflare Access authentication
- üì± Access from anywhere with a custom domain
- üö´ Hide your home IP address

**How it works:**
1. Cloudflared creates an outbound tunnel to Cloudflare
2. Your domain points to Cloudflare
3. Cloudflare routes traffic through the tunnel to your Home Assistant
4. No inbound ports needed!

## Prerequisites

Before installing this addon, you need:

1. **A Cloudflare account** (free tier works)
   - Sign up at https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up

2. **A domain name** managed by Cloudflare
   - Add your domain to Cloudflare (free)
   - Update nameservers at your registrar

3. **A Cloudflare Tunnel** (created via Cloudflare Zero Trust)
   - Go to https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/
   - Navigate to Networks ‚Üí Tunnels
   - Create a new tunnel

## Installation

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Settings** ‚Üí **Add-ons** ‚Üí **Add-on Store**
2. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/ghalpha/homeassistant-addons`
3. Find the "Cloudflared" add-on and click it
4. Click on the "INSTALL" button

## Configuration

### Method 1: Using Tunnel Token (Recommended)

This is the easiest method for most users.

#### Step 1: Create a Tunnel in Cloudflare Dashboard

1. Go to https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/
2. Navigate to **Networks** ‚Üí **Tunnels**
3. Click **Create a tunnel**
4. Choose **Cloudflared** as the connector
5. Give your tunnel a name (e.g., "homeassistant")
6. Click **Save tunnel**

#### Step 2: Copy the Tunnel Token

On the tunnel configuration page, you'll see an installation command like:
```bash
cloudflared service install eyJhIjoixxxxxxx...
```

Copy everything after `install` - that's your tunnel token.

#### Step 3: Configure the Addon

Add to your addon configuration:
```json
{
  "tunnel_token": "eyJhIjoixxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

#### Step 4: Configure the Route in Cloudflare

1. In the Cloudflare tunnel configuration
2. Go to **Public Hostname** tab
3. Click **Add a public hostname**
4. Configure:
   - **Subdomain:** `homeassistant` (or whatever you prefer)
   - **Domain:** `yourdomain.com`
   - **Service Type:** `HTTP`
   - **URL:** `homeassistant.local:8123` or `localhost:8123`
5. Click **Save**

#### Step 5: Start the Addon

1. Start the addon
2. Check the logs for successful connection
3. Access your Home Assistant at `https://homeassistant.yourdomain.com`

---

### Method 2: Using Configuration Options (Advanced)

For more control over routing and multiple services.

#### Configuration Example:

```json
{
  "external_hostname": "homeassistant.yourdomain.com",
  "tunnel_name": "homeassistant",
  "additional_hosts": [
    {
      "hostname": "addon.yourdomain.com",
      "service": "http://localhost:3000"
    },
    {
      "hostname": "files.yourdomain.com",
      "service": "http://localhost:8080"
    }
  ]
}
```

This method requires authenticating with Cloudflare:
1. Run `cloudflared tunnel login` manually
2. Copy the cert.pem file to addon config
3. Create tunnel via CLI

**Most users should use Method 1 (Tunnel Token) instead.**

## Configuring Home Assistant

After setting up the tunnel, you need to tell Home Assistant about the external URL:

### Edit `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  external_url: https://homeassistant.yourdomain.com
  internal_url: http://homeassistant.local:8123
```

### Add to `http:` section:

```yaml
http:
  use_x_forwarded_for: true
  trusted_proxies:
    - 172.30.32.0/23
    - 127.0.0.1
    - ::1
```

**Restart Home Assistant** after making these changes.

## FAQ

### Q: Is this free?
**A:** Yes! Cloudflare's tunnel service is completely free for personal use.

### Q: Will this work with my ISP that uses CGNAT?
**A:** Yes! That's one of the main benefits - it works even behind CGNAT or restrictive NAT.

### Q: Can I use my own domain?
**A:** Yes, as long as your domain is managed by Cloudflare (free to add).

### Q: Does this work with Home Assistant Cloud (Nabu Casa)?
**A:** You can use both, but you only need one. Cloudflare Tunnel is an alternative to Nabu Casa's remote access.

### Q: Will this slow down my Home Assistant?
**A:** There's minimal overhead. Performance is usually comparable to direct access, and Cloudflare's CDN often makes it faster from remote locations.

### Q: Can I use this for other services besides Home Assistant?
**A:** Yes! Use the `additional_hosts` option to tunnel other services.

### Q: Is this secure?
**A:** Yes, very secure. All traffic is encrypted, and you can add Cloudflare Access for additional authentication.

### Q: What happens if Cloudflare goes down?
**A:** Remote access won't work, but local access is unaffected. This is true of any cloud-based remote access solution.
