## Configuration

### Option: `secret_encryption_key` (optional)

A 64-character hex string used for encrypting sensitive data. If not provided, one will be generated automatically. **Important**: Save the generated key in your configuration to persist data across restarts.

**Note**: _You can generate a key using: `openssl rand -hex 32`_

### Option: `port`

The port Homarr will run on. Default is `7575`.

### Option: `enable_docker_integration`

Enable Docker integration to manage containers directly from Homarr. Default is `true`.

**Note**: _Docker integration requires the Docker socket to be mounted, which is handled automatically by this add-on._
